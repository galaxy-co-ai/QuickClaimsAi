Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.38tgmgmqbtcv) 

### Summary

Brad Gibson detailed the limitations of their current system, Job Nimbus, which lacks critical functionality for tracking increase value and requires manual data manipulation for reporting due to the inability of custom data boxes to interact, contrasting it with the superior automated reporting and clean data entry offered by the previously attempted internal solution, Claim Titan. The company requires a new system to calculate metrics like dollar per square, automatically generate reports showing claim increases, and accurately track commission and billing for contractors and estimators based on increased value, while Dalton Cox confirmed the feasibility of all requested features and suggested an initial focus on simplifying the core internal workflow for Brad Gibson's team. Dalton Cox will start by developing a simplified workflow diagram and plans to implement role-based access and prioritize the standard supplement commission structure, with a focus on developing a simple dashboard approach over mobile functionality.

### Details

*Notes Length: Standard*

* **Review of Existing System and Pain Points** Brad Gibson detailed their current use of Job Nimbus for internal processes at Rise, noting its limitations as roofing software that includes features they do not use and lacks critical functionality for their business model, which focuses on tracking increase value rather than traditional revenue metrics ([00:02:17](#00:02:17)). A major pain point is the system's inability to allow custom data boxes to "speak to each other," requiring manual data manipulation in Excel for reporting, which is time-consuming and prone to error ([00:03:20](#00:03:20)) ([00:06:49](#00:06:49)). Dalton Cox acknowledged the need to define the most important work processes ([00:02:17](#00:02:17)).

* **Comparison with Claim Titan** Brad Gibson mentioned Claim Titan as a previous internal attempt that nearly succeeded in meeting their needs, noting that Claim Titan offered automated reporting and a cleaner data entry process ([00:01:01](#00:01:01)) ([00:07:52](#00:07:52)). Specifically, Claim Titan allowed for the calculation of increase value automatically, reducing the need for multiple manual data entries for each claim increase, unlike Job Nimbus where an estimator must repeatedly update total RCV and increase amounts ([00:18:00](#00:18:00)).

* **Need for Seamless Data Tracking and Reporting** The company's operations require specific data points to track claim value relative to the size and quality of the initial adjuster estimate, calculating metrics like dollar per square ([00:05:50](#00:05:50)). Brad Gibson requires a system that can track all supplement box data without the current limitations, enabling automated, customized reports for contractors showing daily updates or summaries of increases ([00:06:49](#00:06:49)). Dalton Cox confirmed that the detailed information being provided is helpful and being captured via transcription ([00:12:52](#00:12:52)).

* **Contractor and Estimator Payment Calculations** Brad Gibson explained the company pays contractors based on a percentage of the increase value and pays estimators a commission (around 5%) based on that increase ([00:16:03](#00:16:03)) ([00:40:13](#00:40:13)). The current software is inefficient, requiring excessive data entry and preventing estimators from easily viewing their current commission ([00:18:00](#00:18:00)) ([00:24:56](#00:24:56)). The required tool needs to easily track contractor and salesperson percentages and automatically generate accurate commission and billing reports based on the recorded increases ([00:16:03](#00:16:03)) ([00:41:13](#00:41:13)).

* **Desirable Features in a New System** Brad Gibson identified several key features needed, including streamlined data entry for core information (policy holder, location/contractor name, initial RCV, total squares), a clean notation system for tracking activity, and housing of documents ([00:10:15](#00:10:15)) ([00:20:07](#00:20:07)). A particularly useful feature from Claim Titan was the ability to pull reports based on the insurance carrier and adjuster, which is valuable for negotiation and tracking claim trends ([00:21:10](#00:21:10)).

* **Simplifying the Workflow and Data Entry** Brad Gibson stressed the simplicity of their core needs, suggesting that current industry software includes unnecessary "fluff" ([00:15:10](#00:15:10)). The focus should be on reducing redundant data entry, where team members currently double their work by entering notes and documents in both their internal system and the contractor's system ([00:35:03](#00:35:03)). Making the process three clicks or less is a goal to improve efficiency for estimators ([00:32:56](#00:32:56)).

* **Potential for Integration and External Sales** Brad Gibson sees potential for the developed solution to be integrated with major platforms like Job Nimbus or Aculinks through an API. This integration could allow them to sell the software independently to other supplementers who currently struggle with roofing-centric software, positioning their solution as highly valuable for the supplementing process ([00:23:57](#00:23:57)) ([00:33:58](#00:33:58)).

* **Focus on Core Internal Workflow (Phase One)** Dalton Cox proposed focusing first on creating a simple, intuitive system centered around Brad Gibson's specific workflow, aiming to polish and refine the internal team's experience. This includes reducing data inputs, ensuring consistent reporting, and providing automated breakdowns of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like dollar per square ([00:28:59](#00:28:59)). Dalton Cox plans to start by developing a simplified workflow diagram to confirm their grasp of the company's internal process before programming the back end ([00:30:18](#00:30:18)).

* **Implementing Role-Based Access and Job Types** Dalton Cox suggested implementing role-based accounts so that different users, like sales staff and contractors, see only the information relevant to them ([00:32:56](#00:32:56)). Brad Gibson identified different job types—supplement, reinspection, estimate, and final invoicing—but agreed to focus initially on the standard supplement commission structure, which accounts for 90% of their work, with other types being added later ([00:39:13](#00:39:13)) ([00:41:13](#00:41:13)).

* **Development Timeline and Next Steps** Dalton Cox confirmed that all requested features are 100% doable and suggested a phased approach, prioritizing a simple dashboard approach over mobile functionality ([00:33:58](#00:33:58)) ([00:45:58](#00:45:58)). The team scheduled a follow-up for the next Friday at noon to review a version of the wireframe; Dalton Cox will send a preliminary version sooner to allow for one round of revisions via email, saving time on the in-person meeting ([00:47:38](#00:47:38)).

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Brad Gibson will send out the calendar invite for the next meeting at 12 o'clock next Friday.  
- [ ] Dalton Cox will create and email a simple workflow diagram to Brad Gibson for review and feedback on any missed items or necessary additions.  
- [ ] Brad Gibson will review the initial version of the system sent by Dalton Cox before the scheduled call and provide feedback on any issues.  
- [ ] Dalton Cox will send Brad Gibson a copy of the meeting transcription notes.

### 00:00:00

   
**Brad Gibson:** Hey, Dalton. Can you hear me? Okay. Oh, I see you. I don't hear you.  
**Dalton Cox:** You should be able to hear me.  
**Brad Gibson:** There you go. Perfect.  
**Dalton Cox:** Awesome. How are you,  
**Brad Gibson:** Good, man. How are you?  
**Dalton Cox:** man?  
**Brad Gibson:** How was uh how was the holidays? How was the new year? How was new or um  
**Dalton Cox:** It was good, man. It was good.  
**Brad Gibson:** Christmas?  
**Dalton Cox:** Just uh working on a few different different things and navigating the in-laws, you know.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. No, that's uh I guess that's the one benefit about living away from my family is the holidays we don't want to be with everybody. We could just chill by ourselves.  
**Dalton Cox:** You just do what you want to do.  
**Brad Gibson:** So So that's been nice.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah, I hear  
**Brad Gibson:** But yeah. Well, cool, man. Well,  
**Dalton Cox:** you.  
**Brad Gibson:** um, so how much did, um, Jason fill you in on?  
   
 

### 00:01:01 {#00:01:01}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Like maybe you give me I I read the notes you put on the the Google meeting, but just, uh, how Yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah,  
**Brad Gibson:** if you don't want to run if you don't mind running through, um, kind of like what what he had said to  
**Dalton Cox:** sure. Um,  
**Brad Gibson:** you.  
**Dalton Cox:** basically he had given and I'm going to close out some other windows I got just so I got quite a bit going on. It'll um basically what he uh said was he referred me he referred back to claim Titan which you and I have discussed that before. um he just kind of touched on it, said if I want to look at that. That was kind of the last, you know, real internal shot that you guys took at getting something going, but it really didn't work out um fully. and he didn't exactly get into specifics of what it was kind of in your process that you were trying to um you know have I say internalize but I mean you know even if you didn't internalize it you know what you were going to softwares you were going to need uh to help you with so it's more like I don't know the work processes that are most important to you right now.  
   
 

### 00:02:17 {#00:02:17}

   
**Dalton Cox:** Um maybe if like we could just kind of define those.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** Were you looking at Oh, he did mention um like outreach. So like sales rabbit or something like  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. So the where the conversation started and where it ended so um we're looking at  
**Dalton Cox:** that.  
**Brad Gibson:** actually two different things. So one um so we use job nimbus right now for our internal part for rise where we do everything. Uh the biggest pain points that we have with it is it's limited because it's roofing software, right? So number one, there's a ton in it we don't use. Um that's just there. But um aside from like the billing piece, cuz the only real true benefit that we find with Job Nimbus where we're like, "Hey, this is something that we don't see with most of the other softwares is when you bill somebody, they're able to pass the credit card fee on to the person without you having to do anything as the business owner." Like where it it they go in and do it and then it's like,  
   
 

### 00:03:20 {#00:03:20}

   
**Brad Gibson:** "Hey, here's the price. If you pay with the credit card, it adds like the actual percentage. Um, aside from that, there's really no benefit we see with Job Nimbus where most of these softwares can't do um like what they do. Uh, the biggest challenge that we have is um like our so we we build everything off of like the increase, right? So, um, so again, a job starts at 10,000, we add 5,000, we we're billing them off of that $5,000 in just that increase, right? None of the softwares are set up like that where it's just about increase value. It's normally dollars, cents, revenue, right? So, but for just our internal it it's we just need as much data about the increase as we can. So in job nimus um if there's more than so basically the way we do it right now is there's uh we can log the first increase because you can do custom boxes but they don't speak to each other. So like I can I can fill out well let me actually just pull up Job Nimbus and just show you an example.  
   
 

### 00:04:32

   
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah, be great.  
**Brad Gibson:** Are you famili Have you ever uh used Job Nimbus by chance?  
**Dalton Cox:** Uh haven't used it personally, but I've explored it as a user just for um you know market  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** research and try to understand  
**Brad Gibson:** I got see  
**Dalton Cox:** it.  
**Brad Gibson:** here. Why is it Oh, there it is. Perfect. Got too many windows open.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yep.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, so, uh, can you see that? Okay. Okay. So,  
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** with Job Nimbus, um, so like for instance, how do I, where's the best place to start? Okay. So, when I go to add a claim, okay, so I'm going to add a contact because I'm going to add a claim. uh when we put the information in. Again, you'll see a lot of these right here. These are all like customized boxes that we put in and we fill out. So, uh like when we the when we get somebody because we track the dollar per square.  
   
 

### 00:05:50 {#00:05:50}

   
**Brad Gibson:** So, in this we put in, hey, there's 37.5 squares on this roof. The initial RCV was uh 20,000. I'm so sorry. The roof RCV, the total RC because the reason we get both of these is um here.  
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** Let's see here.  
**Dalton Cox:** That way you're not counting like the accessories and stuff towards the roof RCV like first  
**Brad Gibson:** Well, well, it's both. Yeah, exactly. So,  
**Dalton Cox:** square.  
**Brad Gibson:** for the tracking of the squares, we just want um for the tracking of the squares, we just want to know what the roof RCV is. So, those so those speak to each other because the the this is what tells us how much meat is on the bone. This is what tells us how well we wrote the estimate. If you had a really good adjuster, they could have wrote the estimate well. So, what that means is um there might not be a lot to increase on the job. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that by any means, but a $10,000 increase could be a bad increase if it should have been $100,000.  
   
 

### 00:06:49 {#00:06:49}

   
**Brad Gibson:** So, it's all in relative the size of the claim and how well it was written from the adjuster.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So we track call it four whatever this we do the math on that but again we just like these to speak to each other. We could just put this in and then it would just calculate what that is because that's essentially what it is. It's this divided by this but we can't do that unless we we have we put it in a  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** report and then split it up and then again so all these boxes are like supplement boxes that we've created and put in here.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, it gives us all the data, but like for reporting and for things that we need for um contractors, we're just so limited unless you have someone going in and splicing up and putting these these these reports together the right way because it they don't speak to each other. So you got to create an Excel spreadsheet, you know, then put in the new data and then have it spit everything out and then, you know, separate those and then send them to uh, you know, each contractor.  
   
 

### 00:07:52 {#00:07:52}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Whereas with Claim Titan, they had automated reporting where it could just spit out whatever report you want to whatever person you wanted, you know, but again, if we don't have the reports based on what we need, we can't do that, you know. So, like I would rather a daily report go to a roofer and tell them everything that's new on there from us. You know, we tell them when an increase is, but one of the issues we have is with, let's say it's a new contractor, we let them know, let them know every time there's a job, but let's say the first of the month hits, then they just get a summary with all this information. So, there's plenty of them that have asked us like, "Hey, is any of this available to us prior?" because like we'll go along with this as we're getting the info almost, you know, whereas they're waiting till that summary report comes in and then doing it. So, we've gotten better because um actually some of our managers have taken upon themselves to be doing some like reporting with them, but the reporting is painful right now, you know,  
   
 

### 00:08:49

   
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** and so these are all custom boxes that don't speak to each other and it just, you know, spits it out within within a column for so so but what we use I mean it's not a crazy amount that we use in the actual software. So, like we no different it has a board system. So, like, uh, let's just go to a specific sales rep  
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** here. Oh, it's being a little slow here. So, if I went to these are and so these are all our people. So, it goes through the steps and they can pull it up on a report or they can see it on their job status because this represents the jobs, right? So here's his completed ones and then um again here's all the active stuff with with the statuses.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So you know most of the softwares have some version of this where you can create the statuses and do that. Um, and then uh and then just when you're in a profile, when you're in a profile, just having a good notation system where because we go back and and we track everything and we want it to be as clean as possible, but it's also just limited in that sense and that was one of the things that was better.  
   
 

### 00:10:15 {#00:10:15}

   
**Brad Gibson:** So, we use this for that beginning entry information, right? the board, the the the notes, and then we house documents. So like any document we have from them, we house it in our system too. So basically anything we have in their system, whatever theirs is, we double up in ours also for them.  
**Dalton Cox:** Who's the the  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. Correct.  
**Dalton Cox:** contractor?  
**Brad Gibson:** Correct. So like and maybe not every one of their their photos or something like that, but um like all the estimates, all there there's a lot of different stuff that that we just do. And then more importantly the documents, you know, all the insurance paperwork, all all that stuff also for it. Then again,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** it has a quick snapshot of of everything that's here. Um, and then if I go to Oops. Man, my computer is being real slow  
**Dalton Cox:** It's uh it's when it Well, maybe it might be your internet,  
**Brad Gibson:** today.  
**Dalton Cox:** but I I've noticed lately like when I go to share a screen like this, it's kind of a similar  
   
 

### 00:11:29

   
**Brad Gibson:** Oh, is it good to know?  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** Okay, so um and then just the other uh where is it? insights. And then the other big thing that we do is just the reports because the one nice thing about this is it's able to just create a a single report of every single job somebody has. Um uh and it it lists it within so our big thing is we do 48 hour follow-ups, right? So every 48 hours you're going to see uh every 48 hours you're going to see an update. So um so we provide the reports that that you can basically do it based on you know the amount of we we provide a report to where they're pulling it up every single day. This is a different one than it, but basically we're they're looking at it based on the last date was updated, you know, for that because so we they need to go through them in order of that. And there's ways to flag other ones and things like that also, but keeping track of the jobs based on the last date updated is basically the big thing they're using their reports for.  
   
 

### 00:12:52 {#00:12:52}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Um, so again, it has it has some decent information on here, but that's it. And if you go to um I will call her back.  
**Dalton Cox:** And just so to give you an idea, just so you know, like because right what you're doing right now is perfect for me.  
**Brad Gibson:** Oh.  
**Dalton Cox:** Um we're we're getting notes on all of this uh via transcription. And so like the more detail you can give me, just just know none of it's lost. Um it's going to I'll have it broken down and I'll even send you a copy of it when we're  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. Cool.  
**Dalton Cox:** done.  
**Brad Gibson:** Cool. And then um and then what was the other thing I wanted to show you? Um, but that's but honestly what I just showed you is the main stuff that we're we're using it for. So now if I go to claim Titan. So now I'm jumping over to Claim Titan real fast.  
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** Um, so again, so here's an example of how so we were able to duplicate um the way these now this is for everybody's but these are this is just in the report system.  
   
 

### 00:13:57

   
**Brad Gibson:** Oh, it just has it different now. Oh, it's just because it's a these are all active claims. Um, there we go. Okay. So, uh, it's for active months is what it's filtered for. Uh, or I'm so sorry, I think it's for last year, but anyways, you could see we haven't been using it basically for the last six months, but we got really close with all the stuff that we wanted. But this would be an example of,  
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** you know, every job when it was updated last. So, they kind of like work off of uh the reports that look like this as they go through their days. Now, the thing that was really uh the the thing that was nice about uh let's see here. Uh the thing that was nice about this was they changed so much  
**Dalton Cox:** I  
**Brad Gibson:** in here even since the last time. Let's see here. So man, they've already like Yeah. So they had a way to So that's for instance, see how many clicks it just got to put into a note.  
   
 

### 00:15:10 {#00:15:10}

   
**Dalton Cox:** was just about to say um it seems like you know it like it's a lot of it's high effort um  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** like you can see they have a good intention but that that does seem a  
**Brad Gibson:** Well, so this was Yeah. And it's it's Pete. It's just Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** lot.  
**Brad Gibson:** It's just s that's the problem with all these is there's just so much extra fluff that it it wasn't necessary.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, um so again, but the nice thing was was it uh they even did it different because again there's a timeline where you could do things that way and put in a new message. So, new comment, new email. So, again, so what's the difference between a message and a note and a it's like all that stuff gets gets really  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** confusing, right? But for for us it's like general and then they get general activity documents. There's all these things but it everything we do is so simple. We don't have this crazy list of things that we do.  
   
 

### 00:16:03 {#00:16:03}

   
**Brad Gibson:** They do this for PAS who try to accommodate every single person and that's from a firm to just an individual person for it but it's not just not the the exact one. So all we So what we need is actually fairly basic. It's um how do we house that? And then on the back end is being able to just um so again we pay the co the contractors uh we charge them a percent of the increase basically.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** Okay. So and then we pay our people um we pay our people based on that increase.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So they get f let's call it 5% of the commission you know. So, we just need an we need to be able to take the reports and again, I need to be able to enter a contractor. I couldn't even show you how to do it on this one here, but enter. So, for instance, if I want to enter Renegade, right, I'd have a place where I just said Renegade Roofing had a spot for your your personal information, just like the business info, and then um put down what your percentage is, what our agreement is, you know, because we charge anywhere from 10 to 15% depending on the volume and  
   
 

### 00:17:13

   
**Dalton Cox:** But when you put a contractor in,  
**Brad Gibson:** whether Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** you should be able to um uh ident you should be able to log what  
**Brad Gibson:** And then when the  
**Dalton Cox:** that what that percentages in their profile. Is that what you're saying?  
**Brad Gibson:** correct and then and then again when they're entering a job for the first time, they're picking the location that it's attached to. So they could go to Renegade and see every single job under Renegade. And then for Renegade, I could Renegade is the name of your company, right? Okay. I was like,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** man, did I did not did I forget?  
**Dalton Cox:** Oh, you're good,  
**Brad Gibson:** Am I just throwing out some some weird random random roofing company?  
**Dalton Cox:** man. No, you're fine.  
**Brad Gibson:** Okay, good. Um but yeah, so uh so I would want to be able to provide you a report that shows and I think they had a show you example of one of the last ones they got together for us.  
   
 

### 00:18:00 {#00:18:00}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Financials for contractor. Let's go to uh RNR last year. Um, so again, this isn't exactly what it would be, but this would be close in terms of if I wanted to send them a bill, and this could be a little bit cleaner because again, we don't they don't need to know the SA like this is for the contractor. They don't need to know the sales our salesperson's name on it. But here's an example, right? It's the job type is a supplement. The initial RCV, this is what the increase was. This is what the final one was. Now, the nice thing with uh because right now in Job Nimbus, if you're an estimator and you get a $2,000 increase, you have to go and put in your $2,000 increase. You then have to go in and change the final RCV number for it because the the total RCV is a different number. Now, we have jobs that have two, three, four increases. So, we just end up uh we just end up allowing people to just have that much more data entry.  
   
 

### 00:19:14

   
**Brad Gibson:** You know, a decimal that's off or a number that's put in incorrectly,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah,  
**Brad Gibson:** we want to limit the exposure.  
**Dalton Cox:** because they're entering it. Every time an increase happens,  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** it gets approved.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** They're they have to go back and reenter a new  
**Brad Gibson:** Correct.  
**Dalton Cox:** one.  
**Brad Gibson:** So we we got it to the point with with them is we just entered the a total RCV and then the new RCV total and then it would do the math and whatever that increase was would then put it on this report for it.  
**Dalton Cox:** Okay.  
**Brad Gibson:** Um and I could probably show you. So here if I were to add a claim. So again we got bet. So again, uh the information here is just that. Again, this says contractor business. This is where we want to be able to put in who the contractors, but this is this would be like the entry field for everything. And then again, let me see.  
   
 

### 00:20:07 {#00:20:07}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Oh, accounting is where they put it. Roof squares, then add an offer. So then once you get to an add an offer, then you're putting in the replacement cost. So again, it's still just not intuitive to what we need. It's like, hey, here's the initial RCV. Here's the total squares. That's all we really need. And it should be able to do the math on the back end for everything else that we need for it, you know. So we need a and again so um so if I told so basic information, so if I were to make a list, it'd be this this basic stuff, right? uh so the policy holder but then there would be a uh location name which would represent the contractor or it could actually be the contractor and I'm saying that because that's the language in job Nimbus right now is location is the contractor's name  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** but for here again I wouldn't even need additional tabs on this I just want to be able to put in all the information that we need right there for them one of the nice things was was  
   
 

### 00:21:10 {#00:21:10}

   
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** uh let's see if it still does it. So this is one of the better things of it was that we really liked was I can go to all state and then um oh probably so I can go to make a long story  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah. What's it do when you do  
**Brad Gibson:** short we it it's supposed to then also let us put in I'm so  
**Dalton Cox:** that?  
**Brad Gibson:** sorry it puts in all state but then one of the other screens is where we actually put in uh the information of like who the exact I mean um who the adjuster is, whether it's the desk adjuster or whatever it is. So, we were able to get a report that show I I could pull a report that said I got 15 state farm jobs, right? And we could literally see how many it was like if there was a every single I could look up like if you were an adjuster, it could see I could see how many claims we've done with you, no matter who the contractor was for that.  
   
 

### 00:22:13

   
**Dalton Cox:** Oh, okay.  
**Brad Gibson:** It was really useful information for that because I can say I got this and if we were getting push back,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah. Say,  
**Brad Gibson:** it allowed you to just easily go back and look at some of the similar stuff.  
**Dalton Cox:** yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** Well, you've approved this before and whether we say it like that or not, we at least have that info to then you use against them.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, that was one of the other really good valuable pieces there. But truthfully, aside from that, like it that was it. Like we don't we don't have big crazy like stuff that we need. It's more data entry is is and housing of, you know, basic documents and that stuff, you know, and so again, we were hoping to link and we've been we've tried, but again, it supplementing is just nobody's main focus. It's nobody's main focus. So, they don't understand just the impact that it is in the business for it.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, it's always just like an like an afterthought with us.  
   
 

### 00:23:07

   
**Brad Gibson:** Like I'm meeting with the CEO of RoofLink next week because again he's saying the same thing but because they just bought sales rabbit and they're trying to do some partnership with us but every single time they promise that they're going to do all these things and nothing ever gets updated the way that you want like no matter what swing it is.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah,  
**Brad Gibson:** I mean Jason results is the number one job Nimus account and they still struggle. It's like if you're not helping your number one client,  
**Dalton Cox:** that's wild. Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** person that has it,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** like who are you doing this for?  
**Dalton Cox:** It should all but be named after him at that  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. You know,  
**Dalton Cox:** point.  
**Brad Gibson:** so what Jason said was that there might be an opportunity is if I give you login for these to where I almost like you could copy them like reverse copy them or something like that like or I I don't he was explaining it to me. I don't know enough to ask the right questions.  
   
 

### 00:23:57 {#00:23:57}

   
**Brad Gibson:** But he's like, if you give him access, we have enough technology yet that we can um duplicate it and and if we get a if he knows what the foundation is, then we can quickly make the tweaks that we need because what we need for it is is fairly simple. It's just more data entry for this. And then the bigger the bigger piece to it I would say and again this would be big picture if we can make it be some sort of add-on or integration to even the biggest like Aculinks um or a job Nimbus then it makes it easy for us to sell and help other people also like because if we can integrate through our stuff whether they're using it or not because there's two ways because here's the other part we're starting to tap into the people that don't use us, right? So, you don't need you have it locked down, but here's what we need to give you all the information um for supplementing.  
**Dalton Cox:** All  
**Brad Gibson:** Like, we could sell that on its own.  
   
 

### 00:24:56 {#00:24:56}

   
**Brad Gibson:** I could just say because all these supplementers come to and they all speak the same language as us and none of the software does. So if I told a supplementer, hey, for a hundred bucks a month, you'd have all your own software for it and it will keep all because it makes their job easier because none of  
**Dalton Cox:** right.  
**Brad Gibson:** the software makes their job easier for it because it's all roofing software. Then there's that ability to it also. So again, the first main thing is just so we in we we internally have it so we can just like it's so valuable for us. would be a gamecher for us because um like because we can connect it to payroll, right? I don't need to be able to process payroll through it. I just need to be able to get the right number. And same thing, a salesperson, they have their own commission. So, you can easily take the data to spit out your your payroll, no matter what it is. And a an adjuster should be able to one of our estimators should just be able to click a button at any time and see how much commission they have, you know, like not not have to do the math or run a report like because we offer those things,  
   
 

### 00:25:54

   
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** but it should just be in in sync like that for them, you know, and then taking that data and just making the most basic dashboard that stares them in the face that says because for us it's like if you're an adjuster, the things we want because we say the same thing. Look, the the dollar amount isn't the most important, but it is we know what the averages should be. So, I want it staring my adjuster, my estimator in the face for someone with rice, saying, "Hey, here's your here's your daily, weekly, yearly, monthly, dollar per square increase, like just the basic data because that's all it is is is numbers and data for it. So it like it would be gamechanging for us and then for there's all these other companies like some of the biggest companies we work with have full built out supplement departments and they work on an Excel spreadsheet and you're just like it's impossible with  
**Dalton Cox:** Hold up. Okay.  
**Brad Gibson:** the amount of or you're just not as efficient as us doing updates every other because it's just not possible to do  
   
 

### 00:26:50

   
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** to do it that way, you know, with the amount of um updates and the amount of um uh I I always avoid the word negotiation with the insurance, right? But at the end of the day, we're going back and forth with them about the the correct cost of the job. So, so again that like it's super basic what we need and it's it's a little bit of of both of those, but if we're able to just do that piece, like not only are we willing to just internally pay like for that, but like it's something that we could turn around and if it's I I don't know how easy or hard it is,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** no different than I told you before. Whenever you and Jason are ready on whatever project, I can sell the f\*\*\* out of it.  
**Dalton Cox:** Right. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** So,  
**Dalton Cox:** No,  
**Brad Gibson:** so it doesn't matter like like what it is,  
**Dalton Cox:** I have no doubt in that.  
**Brad Gibson:** when it is, Jason knows that, you know, and again like all these things, everything we do, we know other people need, just not on a bigger scale for it,  
   
 

### 00:27:54

   
**Dalton Cox:** Right.  
**Brad Gibson:** you know. So, so that's where again internally for us, we know it would help. And Jason's like, I really think based on what you guys need, it's not going to be crazy hard for us to piece something like this together because it is just data. We just need to know what the framework is. So, so let me just pause right there because I just said a  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah. No, dude. And the I I appreciate that.  
**Brad Gibson:** lot.  
**Dalton Cox:** That is um I couldn't even ask the right questions to get that kind of internal um perspective on this, but that's honestly what like is most needed. So, um, to go back to what Jason mentioned to you about, um, we do have, you know, since I first met you guys and to this point, um, my just my local development environment, um, has increased exponentially and it's allowing me to do, um, it's allowing us to kind of push a lot of limits, which is really nice. But one thing, um, so could we go back and recreate these um, in certain ways?  
   
 

### 00:28:59 {#00:28:59}

   
**Dalton Cox:** without a doubt that because what we're looking at here are um it's it's basically it's u it's well tiered spreadsheets more or less. Um and I mean spreadsheets and forms whether it's filling out a note it's just the same as an intake form. Um but the more important part really is because I think  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** this is kind of where you guys are if I'm hearing this right. It's the impact that you're asking for, but you can't quite shape the features to it is the intuitiveness of your specific workflow and nothing more in the heart of it. Just, you know, um I I would almost say phase one or checkpoint one is let's really polish refine a system that works for your internal team. Um, and that means, you know, we'd be reducing data inputs. um we'd be looking at more consistent reporting and then you know faster and more automated breakdowns based on the you know the KPIs or key performance indicators you're looking for whether that's um you know price per square um you know average increase average time to close whatever you we can massage that and highlight those but just making sure that like the first core workflow is correct and then it's  
   
 

### 00:30:18 {#00:30:18}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** like you know all you know a month in you say like you we notice that your estimators are having to put hardly any notes in. We've got a centralized change log where all of those notes and everybody sees the updates.  
**Brad Gibson:** Hey, I'm so I'm so sorry.  
**Dalton Cox:** Um go ahead.  
**Brad Gibson:** I need to grab this real fast. One second.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** Okay, sorry about that. That was our main line.  
**Dalton Cox:** No, you're fine. really. But I mean just my first focus would be um I would I I want  
**Brad Gibson:** Um  
**Dalton Cox:** to create a a real simple workflow diagram of what I'm grasping and I'll email it to you and you can just basically reply to the email of you know things I missed where it's like hey you know like we're we add comments in between these two checkpoints you have here or we do this and this and what we what that would do is um it would give us the foundation so I can go in and then program the back end and say listen here is the black and white I mean it looks like Microsoft like Windows 97 diagram of what these guys are doing internally so then it's no longer you're not like an add-on tool like you know the tool is centered around your head workflow and then we can kind of branch that workflow from there.  
   
 

### 00:32:56 {#00:32:56}

   
**Dalton Cox:** I mean I I think nailing that initial internal part for you.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** um like you know consistent reporting, a really streamlined reporting process to where it's like you know and then we can um we can slowly trim the fat of like hey we're still having to input comments here and this way it goes um it's less of a process of me trying to figure out what all tools we could put for you because I think that's the trap claim Titan kind of fell into. Um,  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** and it's more so we're looking at all the areas we can prune until it feels like, you know, this is a three-click process and we're done, you know, and then it's like, okay, what would be the best thing we could add now?  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** Whether um, you know, it's role-based um, accounts. So then, you know, your your sales guys have a different style of account as your but contractors have their own style of account. So that way anybody that logs in sees exactly what they want to see.  
   
 

### 00:33:58 {#00:33:58}

   
**Dalton Cox:** They're not sifting through like other dashboards and stuff. And then um the integrations where and all that is Brad is we we write down the companies that you guys like Job Nimbus or Aculinks and we go to them which you guys being one of their biggest accounts. It wouldn't be a big I don't think it'd be too hard to get the info but all we would have to do is um get an API key from them which is really common now. Um and then it we immediately could onboard these other um these tools that you're using. So the things you're asking for they're not out of the question. Like everything you've asked um I haven't heard anything that everything that I've heard is 100% doable. The order in which we go about it I think that's like you know how fast can we show like can you see some results in like your processes? Is it getting smoother or not? And then we can kind of build it out. you know, it it just won't be nearly as you almost start just so dead simple, you know, and um  
   
 

### 00:35:03 {#00:35:03}

   
**Brad Gibson:** Hey, I'm okay if it looks like doss as long as it gives us all the info that we need,  
**Dalton Cox:** that's sure.  
**Brad Gibson:** you know, it can it can get prettier in the future like um but hey,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah. Yeah. It'll look good.  
**Brad Gibson:** I just Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** Don't worry about that.  
**Brad Gibson:** No, no,  
**Dalton Cox:** But yeah,  
**Brad Gibson:** you know what I mean, though. Like it's it's not about it's just about as as little because  
**Dalton Cox:** the bells and whistles  
**Brad Gibson:** because again if my people could just go to this software and we're integrated with Job Nimbus and  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** we could they could type in a note and that note is duplicated to that same profile on theirs and same thing because right now they're they're essentially doubling all their work.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** Anything they type they're doing it twice.  
**Dalton Cox:** It's a lot of It does sound like a lot of um redundant data in uh  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. which it which it is.  
**Dalton Cox:** entry.  
   
 

### 00:35:46

   
**Brad Gibson:** So it's like if we could remove that and make our you know for us it's always like how can you make the estimator's job better and easier. I did just send you an email just want to make sure you got it to the Dalton home advice. Um so this was the updated stat. So these are the statuses like like within the internal system that we use. So like the jobs go to the these are the statuses for each one. So when they sit on that uh when it sits on that job board, it's probably easier to show you on the Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** I'm looking at your email too right now  
**Brad Gibson:** So if you pull  
**Dalton Cox:** though.  
**Brad Gibson:** up um So there's only one ahead of So there's one that says um new supplement basically. See on my screen there? That's the only one that's different than missing info to start.  
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** But essentially, that's what it is. We don't move it past new supplement if there's missing info, if that makes sense.  
   
 

### 00:36:48

   
**Dalton Cox:** Got it.  
**Brad Gibson:** But the rest of them, you can see contractor review, contractor review, supplement sent to insurance. So you can see, so these are these are the steps that the job goes through when when they do  
**Dalton Cox:** That's perfect, man.  
**Brad Gibson:** that.  
**Dalton Cox:** Okay.  
**Brad Gibson:** And then same thing for location. This is just all the different contractors. So, if I wanted to look at it based on um and and just so you know,  
**Dalton Cox:** I  
**Brad Gibson:** the boards I don't know how easy or hard that is. Uh yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** mean, if you guys like them, they're not hard.  
**Brad Gibson:** I mean it's I'd say that's secondary. That's not the first thing to it if that makes sense for it.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** But um it is good being able to just like visually being able to look and it lets  
**Dalton Cox:** What stage is  
**Brad Gibson:** you know yeah what stage is that or or if if you notice any  
**Dalton Cox:** that?  
**Brad Gibson:** trends if if so this is one that's been oh it's because I got the sales rep that's  
   
 

### 00:37:41

   
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** why um so you notice if certain ones are piling up on like a certain spot you know like you start to notice for it also  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** but they work off of their individual report, which is that other thing that I was showing you, which is Oh, you know what else I was going to do is go to um That's right. If I went to somebody and I went to financials. So this is how like or and this is an so estimator would come in here and they would go to add budget. Okay. And this is they would come here and then again price the amount and this is where they would basically enter their commission for it. Yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** Sales record.  
**Brad Gibson:** but but it really but same thing all we need they don't need they shouldn't have to enter a sales commission if there is an increase it should be just based on their percentage right we should just be able to if anything we just need to be able to have a list of our salespeople with what their commission is like hey they get a percent off of this increase and then same thing instead of them having to enter this separately.  
   
 

### 00:39:13 {#00:39:13}

   
**Dalton Cox:** Mhm.  
**Brad Gibson:** They could just get a list of their commissions for for what it  
**Dalton Cox:** Your sales reps um are, you know, your estimators,  
**Brad Gibson:** is.  
**Dalton Cox:** do they do they each have um I know their percentages may be different from each other, but do their does their percentage stay the same for every  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** job?  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. So, it's like their percentage as the salesperson. It's not per job for it. It's based our agreement is with the salesperson and and they're they're all at um 5% but we do  
**Dalton Cox:** Who?  
**Brad Gibson:** have some variation um and then uh so so basically we would need because there's different how do I say this? So they should just be picking the job type because there's a supplement, there's a reinspection and there's an estimate. Those are the three things they can get or and then there's a fi or uh what would I say the um final invoicing.  
**Dalton Cox:** All  
**Brad Gibson:** So there's actually four different ways that they can get paid.  
   
 

### 00:40:13 {#00:40:13}

   
**Brad Gibson:** 90% of it is just your standard supplement, but we do have other like flat fee stuff. Like we can someone can have us just write an estimate for a flat fee where it's just like there's a there's a an estimate fee where they just get a flat $40 for their basic estimate that they wrote. We don't do any follow-up. We don't do so there's that stuff too. So that would be here receive where this says supplement commission. It would there should just be options where it's like supplement but instead of that I'm putting it in as an estimate instead of that I'm putting in as as a whatever that case is. So there are a few different ones but the the nuts and bolts of it or like a reinspection is is um a different price. But I think if we have it more to where it's just the salesperson, this is what their percentage is. This is the contractor. this is what their percentage is because again we bill them 12 and a half our our uh our supplement our estimator estimator salesp person whatever you want to call them they get 5%.  
   
 

### 00:41:13 {#00:41:13}

   
**Dalton Cox:** right.  
**Brad Gibson:** So we should be able to really easily do that math to have it spit out those numbers and have a report that shows what the increase is in terms of what the contractor owes and a report to the salesperson to show them what their commission is with a basic breakdown of how it got there. It's like, hey, this was the starting, this was the final,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** this was the increase for  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah, makes sense. And um initially what I what I'll probably start with on as far as the the job description  
**Brad Gibson:** it.  
**Dalton Cox:** um is I will start with just your basic supplement commission and we nail that,  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah, for  
**Dalton Cox:** you know,  
**Brad Gibson:** sure.  
**Dalton Cox:** and we get the different views and then once you're like, man, that's perfect. We need to add these different types. That's no issue.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, yes, perfect. So, see how it says right here? Oh, this is says contact type, but this so again this is this ideally instead of contact type would be job type.  
   
 

### 00:42:09

   
**Brad Gibson:** So again, we'll just focus on just a basic supplement,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah,  
**Brad Gibson:** but that's what it would trigger the different kind of job that it is before you're entering it in. So that way if it's an estimate and you're not getting paid off the percentage, you'll go to a different bucket, if that makes sense.  
**Dalton Cox:** totally.  
**Brad Gibson:** So, but with that being said,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yep.  
**Brad Gibson:** um um I was about to  
**Dalton Cox:** Those right there. So if um if  
**Brad Gibson:** say I'm going to just  
**Dalton Cox:** I load um are they taking those numbers just straight from the  
**Brad Gibson:** think  
**Dalton Cox:** um scope that they received from the  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** adjuster.  
**Brad Gibson:** And that's what we were saying, like the bigger bigger picture would be if they could just take their scope, upload it to it,  
**Dalton Cox:** Load it.  
**Brad Gibson:** and then it would just spit it out. But honestly, I think if I um trying  
**Dalton Cox:** Here, I can take a quick screenshot of  
**Brad Gibson:** to Yeah, I was going to say just do that real fast because realistically this is all the stuff that we  
   
 

### 00:43:03

   
**Dalton Cox:** that.  
**Brad Gibson:** need.  
**Dalton Cox:** All right, I got that. Uh, you want to scroll down just so I can make sure I  
**Brad Gibson:** Oh,  
**Dalton Cox:** got  
**Brad Gibson:** see this is where we were. See, we had to do a custom field to put what it was, whether it's a supplement, estimate, or a reinspect,  
**Dalton Cox:** Okay.  
**Brad Gibson:** and then we'd have to spit it out on a report, splice it up, tell us which ones are which, then go back through it. So you could imagine and with all these custom ones if someone types it in wrong, right?  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** Like like if I'm trying to pull something for for uh what would be for like the saleserson and the salesperson isn't our salesperson, it's like um the company. So if you had a salesperson, you want to say, "Hey, I want my totals for so and so." If they if they called you Dalton on one and then you had a nickname that was something else or spell different or Chris with an R,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:44:04

   
**Brad Gibson:** Chris with an H like like it's it's all different when then when you pull it up and then when you get into multiple estimators working on different ones um these this is what it would be. So certain ones of these should be like drop-own boxes that are preloaded with our information,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.  
**Brad Gibson:** you know, but again just so you know, this is just the basic information that we need.  
**Dalton Cox:** Understood. Well, um, as far like just from what I've gathered on this, um, I can actually take a pretty, honestly, Brad, like a really high quality run at this. Um, like I said, what I'm going to do very first is just give you a very wireframe look at the workflow. Um, I know that one you sent me. And so, um, and you just give me the green light on it and I'll I'll I'll turn that into, okay, you know, where do the automations fit in? You know, what's happening a lot, all that crap. And then I mean that that's pretty much it.  
   
 

### 00:45:05

   
**Brad Gibson:** Yep.  
**Dalton Cox:** Like I to not over complicate it. Um, to keep it just so here's what you're wanting, here's what it does.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** And then then you you know as soon as you feel like it's a a really smooth system you can flex on it a little bit and say hey so if we can add this in because that's when you'll see like a big drop in um revisions is if we get the first core down um then the the requests you make are just they're buildons.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
**Dalton Cox:** They're we just build on to it. We don't try to nail your whole vision in one one sweep,  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah. Well,  
**Dalton Cox:** you know.  
**Brad Gibson:** the my my what I've learned with this for what we need,  
**Dalton Cox:** Sure.  
**Brad Gibson:** it's definitely a less is more approach.  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah. And that's tough. I mean,  
**Brad Gibson:** Hey.  
**Dalton Cox:** I I equate it to trying to make a nickel out of a Coke can. Um,  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:45:58 {#00:45:58}

   
**Dalton Cox:** it is tough because it's a it's a very compressing project process, but you want the density to still be there. It's just you need it in a in a shape that is just very simple and straightforward. And I get that. Um, one nice thing is it seems like you're okay with this being a dashboard uh approach to begin with and then we could migrate it to mobile after that.  
**Brad Gibson:** Yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** Is that all right?  
**Brad Gibson:** to be honest, the mobile is the least of my worries right now.  
**Dalton Cox:** And yeah,  
**Brad Gibson:** All Yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** and for the in office stuff I just I assume that that's  
**Brad Gibson:** all of our estimators uh they all work from home and to be honest when they're out and about.  
**Dalton Cox:** great.  
**Brad Gibson:** I mean, that would be that would be a great perk. I think that's kind of like Yeah. So, that'd be awesome, but yeah, that's not um on the Yeah,  
**Dalton Cox:** That can be in the version three or four.  
**Brad Gibson:** I'd rather that time being spent on whatever things within it, you know.  
   
 

### 00:46:49

   
**Brad Gibson:** Um,  
**Dalton Cox:** Sure.  
**Brad Gibson:** and then just one note. So, so even as simple as it is,  
**Dalton Cox:** Yeah.
