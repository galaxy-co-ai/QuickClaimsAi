# Ice & Water Shield - Code Requirement Argument

## Summary
Ice barrier is required by building code in areas with average January temperature of 25°F or less. This is not optional—it's a code mandate.

---

## Code Reference

### IRC 2021 Section R905.2.7.1 - Ice Barrier
> "In areas where there has been a history of ice forming along the eaves causing a backup of water, an ice barrier that consists of at least two layers of underlayment cemented together or of a self-adhering polymer-modified bitumen sheet shall be used in lieu of normal underlayment and extend from the lowest edges of all roof surfaces to a point at least 24 inches (610 mm) inside the exterior wall line of the building."

### IRC 2021 Section R905.1.2 - Climate Zones
> "Ice barriers shall be required in climate zones where the average daily January temperature is 25°F (-4°C) or less."

---

## Argument Template

### Short Version (Email/Phone)
```
Per IRC R905.2.7.1, ice barrier is required for this property location. 
The code mandates self-adhering ice & water shield extending 24" past 
the interior wall line at all eaves and valleys. This is a building 
code requirement, not an upgrade.
```

### Full Version (Written Supplement)
```
ITEM: Ice & Water Shield (RFGIWS)
QUANTITY: [X] SF
UNIT PRICE: $1.63/SF
TOTAL: $[AMOUNT]

JUSTIFICATION:
Per the International Residential Code (IRC) Section R905.2.7.1, 
ice barrier installation is mandatory for structures located in areas 
where the average January temperature is 25°F or below.

[CITY, STATE] falls within this requirement zone.

The code specifically requires:
- Self-adhering polymer-modified bitumen sheet
- Coverage from lowest roof edge to minimum 24" inside exterior wall line
- Application at all eave edges and valleys

This is a building code compliance requirement, not an optional upgrade.
Failure to include this item results in a non-code-compliant repair.

Reference: IRC 2021, Section R905.2.7.1

## Carrier-Specific Notes

### State Farm
- **Acceptance rate**: High with code citation
- **Required documentation**: IRC reference, climate zone map
- **Notes**: Usually approves with first submission

### Allstate
- **Acceptance rate**: Medium
- **Required documentation**: May need photos of existing (or lack thereof)
- **Notes**: Sometimes requires supervisor review

### Travelers
- **Acceptance rate**: High
- **Required documentation**: Simple IRC citation usually sufficient
- **Notes**: Quick approvals typical

### Progressive
- **Acceptance rate**: Medium
- **Required documentation**: Full code citation + climate data
- **Notes**: May need local code adoption proof

## Counter-Arguments

### If Denied: "Property not in cold climate zone"
Response:
```
The property is located in [CITY, STATE]. According to NOAA climate data,
the average January temperature for this location is [X]°F, which is at or
below the 25°F threshold specified in IRC R905.2.7.1. Climate zone maps
from the ICC confirm this property falls within the ice barrier requirement zone.
```

### If Denied: "Not required by local code"
Response:
```
[STATE] has adopted the [YEAR] International Residential Code with amendments.
The ice barrier requirement in Section R905.2.7.1 remains in effect for this
jurisdiction. The local building department can confirm this requirement applies.
```

### If Denied: "Existing roof didn't have ice barrier"
Response:
```
Per IRC Section R908.3, when more than 25% of the roof covering is replaced,
the entire roof must be brought into compliance with current code requirements.
This replacement exceeds that threshold, requiring ice barrier installation
to meet current building code.
```

## Xactimate Entry

**Code**: RFGIWS
**Description**: Ice & water barrier
**Unit**: SF
**Current Price**: $1.63/SF (verify with current price list)

**Quantity Calculation**:
- Eave length × 6 feet (typical 24" past interior wall = 6' from edge)
- Add valleys: Valley length × 3 feet (minimum each side)
- Add any low-slope areas where required
